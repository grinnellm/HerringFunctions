# Helper functions for Pacific Herring scripts

This script is used to support several of my scripts; the different versions have been replaced with one official version on **GitHub**.
I need to turn this into an **R** package.
First, I need a good package name!
Options include:

1. phFun (for Pacific Herring functions), 
2. Some recursive acronym regarding herring, or
3. mhg (or something to do with my name).

Also, I need to get **Rtools** working on my machine.
I'm not sure why it isn't working -- I followed [Hadley's instructions](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/package.html).
